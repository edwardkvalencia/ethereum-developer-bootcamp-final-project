# Supply Chain Dapp

<b>Overview:</b> 

Creating a project that tracks packages/containers as they depart from their place of origin to their final destination. All parties will be required to verify they have received the package as it goes down the chain. 

<b>Why? </b>

Our current supply chain information infrustructure is outdated and there is no single point of reliable information. Every party has their own database with thier own entries. This makes it difficult to rely on data that is handed off to you. Making it distributed, while giving access to the parties involved increases the validity of the information.
